# Conway's Game of Life

This application is intended to allow simulation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

It is both for fun and an excuse for me to learn JavaScript.
I briefly explored the Game of Life using Python in early 2020, 
but it's amazing how quickly you can build interactive apps using the web browser.

## TODO
1. Allow saving of runs in database
2. Allow addition of custom shapes to dropdown menu by user
3. Add styling to make web page attractive
4. Fix shape overlap at grid edge
5. Refactor to follow JS best practices
